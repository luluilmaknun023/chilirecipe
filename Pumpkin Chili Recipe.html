<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instructions :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a 5 quart (or larger) pot or dutch oven. Add the onion, bell peppers, and jalape&ntilde;o. Stir and cook for 5 minutes as the onion softens. Add garlic, salt, black pepper, cumin, chili powder, and onion powder. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add the remaining ingredients including black beans, if using.<br />2. Place the lid on top, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br />3. Serve with any optional toppings. I strongly suggest cilantro for a little fresh kick. Yum.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. <strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong> Chili freezes wonderfully for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then heat in a large pot on medium heat for 20-30 minutes.<br />2. <strong>Spiciness:</strong> This chili, as written, is mildly spicy. Feel free to adjust the chili powder based on your spice tolerance. You can leave out the jalape&ntilde;o if desired. If removing some spice, however, keep in mind that some flavor will be lost. You can add a little more cumin, garlic, or onion powder in its place.<br />3. <strong>Beans:</strong> You can use any beans you enjoy. I found the textures of pinto, kidney, and black beans perfect for this chili. You can use light or dark kidney beans, whichever you prefer. I added 1/2 of a can of black beans at the last minute. They&rsquo;re optional, but very tasty in this dish. Chick peas would be great here, so feel free to make a swap.<br />4. <strong>Pumpkin:</strong> I recommend using canned pumpkin puree over homemade in this recipe, though 2 cups of homemade would be fine in a pinch.<br />5. <strong>Sweet Potato:</strong> Feel free to substitute peeled and diced butternut squash.<br />6. <strong>Slow Cooker Instructions:</strong> Place all of the ingredients in a 5 quart or larger slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours.</p>
