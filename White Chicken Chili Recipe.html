<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /><strong>Instructions :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute 4 minutes minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer.<br />2. Add chicken broth, green chilies, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, cayenne pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring mixture just to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes.<br />3. Drain and rinse beans in a fine mesh strainer or colander then measure out 1 cup. Set whole beans aside, transfer 1 cup beans to a food processor along with 1/4 cup broth from soup, puree until nearly smooth.<br />4. Add Neufchatel cheese to soup along with corn, whole beans and pureed beans and stir well. Simmer 5 - 10 minutes longer.<br />5. Stir in chicken, fresh lime juice and cilantro.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Recipe updated to use pre-cooked shredded chicken (previously used raw chicken in this recipe and cooked at the beginning). I like the flavor of rotisserie chicken better plus this way you don't end with over-cooked chicken breasts.<br />- If you don't own a food processor you can skip the pureeing step, soup just won't be quite as creamy.</p>
